PROJECT 2 DEVELOPMENT


Specification:

- Program must compile with a "gcc" or "g++" call

- User input? -> SIC/XE object file & symbol file
// symbol file includes SYMTAB & LITTAB

- Program Output? -> SIC/XE source file & listing file

Design:

***WHAT DO WE NEED?***

- numeric converters...
(hex to int, hex to bin, bin to hex)
// these results may need to be handled as strings

- SIC/XE registers

- a complete opcode table (for instructions & formats)
// use a structure?

*for disassembling...*

- a way to interate through SYMTAB & LITTAB
// use vectors?  or maps?

- a way to interate through records in object code
// vectors again?

- a way to determine addresses & lengths based on format type
// store displacement/address?

- a way to determine addressing modes
(ALSO, calculate target addresses)
(AND, add proper addressing mode symbol)
// array for "nixbpe" flags?
